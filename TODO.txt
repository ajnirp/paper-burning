model spread velocity --DONE
	random for each cell
	possibly use a probability of spreading? --DONE

model temperature of a cell --SOMEWHAT DONE
	temperature influences the color of a cell (red hot, white hot, etc.)
	look at t - burn_start to determine temperature
		how to model temperature falloff? --LINEAR (can improve on this?)

improve gradual charring

precompute spread probabilities via a normalized grayscale texture

main aim - decouple simulation from rendering
	possibly separate programs
